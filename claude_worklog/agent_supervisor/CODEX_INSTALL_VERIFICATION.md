Arguments:
  [PROMPT]
          Optional user prompt to start the session

Options:
  -c, --config <key=value>
          Override a configuration value that would otherwise be loaded from
          `~/.codex/config.toml`. Use a dotted path (`foo.bar.baz`) to override
          nested values. The `value` portion is parsed as TOML. If it fails to
          parse as TOML, the raw string is used as a literal.
          
          Examples: - `-c model="o3"` - `-c
          'sandbox_permissions=["disk-full-read-access"]'` - `-c
          shell_environment_policy.inherit=all`

      --enable <FEATURE>
          Enable a feature (repeatable). Equivalent to `-c features.<name>=true`

      --disable <FEATURE>
          Disable a feature (repeatable). Equivalent to `-c
          features.<name>=false`

      --remote <ADDR>
          Connect the TUI to a remote app server websocket endpoint.
          
          Accepted forms: `ws://host:port` or `wss://host:port`.

      --remote-auth-token-env <ENV_VAR>
          Name of the environment variable containing the bearer token to send
          to a remote app server websocket

  -i, --image <FILE>...
          Optional image(s) to attach to the initial prompt

  -m, --model <MODEL>
          Model the agent should use

      --oss
          Use open-source provider

      --local-provider <OSS_PROVIDER>
          Specify which local provider to use (lmstudio or ollama). If not
          specified with --oss, will use config default or show selection

  -p, --profile <CONFIG_PROFILE>
          Configuration profile from config.toml to specify default options

  -s, --sandbox <SANDBOX_MODE>
          Select the sandbox policy to use when executing model-generated shell
          commands
          
          [possible values: read-only, workspace-write, danger-full-access]

      --dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox
          Skip all confirmation prompts and execute commands without sandboxing.
          EXTREMELY DANGEROUS. Intended solely for running in environments that
          are externally sandboxed

  -C, --cd <DIR>
          Tell the agent to use the specified directory as its working root

      --add-dir <DIR>
          Additional directories that should be writable alongside the primary
          workspace

  -a, --ask-for-approval <APPROVAL_POLICY>
          Configure when the model requires human approval before executing a
          command

          Possible values:
          - untrusted:  Only run "trusted" commands (e.g. ls, cat, sed) without
            asking for user approval. Will escalate to the user if the model
            proposes a command that is not in the "trusted" set
          - on-failure: DEPRECATED: Run all commands without asking for user
            approval. Only asks for approval if a command fails to execute, in
            which case it will escalate to the user to ask for un-sandboxed
            execution. Prefer `on-request` for interactive runs or `never` for
            non-interactive runs
          - on-request: The model decides when to ask the user for approval
          - never:      Never ask for user approval Execution failures are
            immediately returned to the model

      --search
          Enable live web search. When enabled, the native Responses
          `web_search` tool is available to the model (no per‑call approval)

      --no-alt-screen
          Disable alternate screen mode
